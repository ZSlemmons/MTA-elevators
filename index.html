  <p>Ask any average New Yorker and they’ll tell you that the subway is 
    the life blood of the city. With 8.5 million 
    people sharing a meager 300 square meters of land, public transit
     is a necessity. If you’ve ever tried to take a cab during rush 
     hour, you’ll understand why.</p>

  <p>Free from the whims of city traffic, the subway is an efficient
     and cost effective way to get around. For $2.90 you can get 
     almost anywhere you want to go within the five boroughs – as 
     long as it’s not on Staten Island. </p>

            <p>THE STATIONS<br><br>The vast network of interconnected 
              train lines can be accessed through 475 subway stations citywide</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" id="step2">
            <p>THE PROBLEM<br><br>But many of these stations are 
              inaccessible to the estimated 11% of New Yorkers 
              with ambulatory disabilities. </p>

      <p>Analysis shows that only about one third of MTA stations
         are wheelchair accessible. The lack of accessibility can 
         be attributed in large part to the subway’s age. The oldest 
         parts of the system first opened in 1904, with construction 
         continuing to expand the network through the 1920s. </p>

      <p>Compared with other U.S. metro systems, the MTA is lagging 
        behind in terms of accessibility. Washington D.C.’s metro system 
        is fully accessible. Chicago’s “L” system is 70% accessible 
        according to the Chicago Transit Authority website.</p>

      <p>However, these comparisons don’t take into account factors 
        like the NYC subway’s age and size. The first sections of the 
        D.C. metro system didn’t open until 1976, and while Chicago’s
         “L” is even older than the subway, it is also much smaller 
         – with only about one third the number of stations.</p>  

      <p>A more accurate comparison can be made to some international 
        metro systems. According to its website, London’s Underground,
         which dates back to the late 19th century, offers step-free 
         access in about one third of its stations – a number very 
         comparable to NYC. The Tokyo metro, which opened in 1927, 
         boasts a whopping 95% accessibility according to the Japan 
         Accessible Tourism Center. The Paris metro, on the other hand,
          has full wheelchair accessibility in just under 10% of 
          stations according to Ile de France Mobilites. </p>

      <p>Following the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act 
        in 1990, the MTA began the process of introducing elevators into 
        100 of the city’s most important metro hubs. In 2022, the agency 
        settled a class action lawsuit with disabled riders, promising to 
        dedicate a minimum of 8% of each capital budget to accessibility 
        upgrades. Under the terms of the settlement, the subway system is 
        projected to achieve 95% accessibility by 2055. </p>

      <p>In the meantime, accessibility remains a challenge for New Yorkers
         with ambulatory disabilities. An analysis of a hundred randomly 
         selected trips showed that accessible commutes were an average 
         of nine minutes longer than regular commutes. </p>

      <p>That analysis, however, included some trips that were naturally 
        between two accessible stations, meaning the accessible commute
         was identical to the regular one. With those trips removed from,
         the analysis shows accessible commutes were, on average, 
         almost 20 minutes longer. Many of the accessible commutes, 
         however, involved taking a bus instead of, or in addition to the subway.
         For most, no bus-less route was available. The buses however, 
         are subject to traffic delays, particularly during peak commute times. </p>

      <p>For those fortunate enough to have accessible stations on both
         ends of their commute, the success of their trip still hinges
         on one, notoriously fickle piece of equipment – the elevator. </p> 
        
        </div>
    <div class="full-width">
        <figure>
            <video src="elevator-video.MOV" preload="auto" tabindex="0" playsinline autoplay loop muted></video>
        </figure>
    </div>

      <p>This can be particularly problematic when an elevator goes out 
         of service at one of those accessible stations. </p>

      <p>An analysis of data collected over a  3-day period from 
        Aug. 2 to Aug. 5, showed an average of 9% of elevators were 
        out of service per day.</p>   

      <p>In total, 129 individual elevators were out of service at 
        some point during that period. Roughly a quarter of those 
        outages were due to the Capital Replacement plan – the 
        agency’s ongoing effort to improve accessibility. </p> 
        
      <p>About a third of the outages were the result of unplanned 
        repairs or investigations. </p>  

      <p>According to MTA data, since 2015, close to half of all 
        elevator outages (47%) have been unplanned. These unplanned 
        outages make it difficult for disabled commuters, who may arrive 
        at their destination only to discover they can’t exit the station</p>
        
      <p>The duration of outages varied widely, with some issues getting 
        resolved in a matter of hours, while others took elevators out
         of service for days. The average turn around time for elevator
          repairs was approximately 9 days. </p>  

      <p>Elevator outages can be particularly disruptive for disabled
         riders in neighborhoods where accessible stations are few 
         and far between. </p>   
      
      <p>City wide, the average distance between accessible stations is
         half a mile, or about 10 city blocks. That’s close to twice 
         the distance between all subway stations – which is roughly 
         six blocks.</p>

      <p>But the distance between accessible stations varies 
              greatly across different parts of the city, and may not 
              align with the areas most in need of accessibility</p>

            <p>Analysis shows that areas with the highest number of
               accessible stations, tend to have the lowest populations
                of New Yorkers with ambulatory disability</p>
          </div>
          <div class="step" id="step4">
            <p>While areas with the largest disabled populations are 
              often underserved by accessible stations. </p>
          </div>
        </div>
        </section>

      <p>This discrepancy is not limited to accessible stations. 
        The same areas are typically underserved by subway stations
         in general. However a disproportionate percentage of accessible
         stations are packed into Manhattan’s central business district
          – about one in three compared to 1 in 5 subway stations overall. </p>

      <p>The MTA says it’s picking up the pace on accessibility improvements.
         According to its latest capital plan, the agency has achieved 
         ADA compliance in 46 stations since 2020, with 43 still under 
         construction.</p>

      <p>The current budget allocates $7.1 billion to upgrade another 
        60 stations in the coming years. For disabled New Yorkers, the 
        changes can’t come soon enough. </p>
